# CS 3450 - Tools Co-op

## An explanation of the organization and name scheme for the workspace:

## Version-control procedures:

Tool stack description and setup procedure:

## Build instructions:

The build instructions for this project are difficult to pin down because we're still in the earlier stages of development. We don't have large amounts of code that needs to be run. We'll update the README as more and more things are implemented.

## Unit testing instructions:

As far as unit testing goes our plan is to have the author of the original code debug it as much as he/she can. Once satisfied, the author will request a review from a different member of the group. This peer reviewer will try his best to find more bugs for the author to sort out. The process can be repeated as many times as necessary.

## System testing instructions:

System testing will be a more rigorous iteration of what was described for the unit testing instructions, but this process will be applied to the system. Each team member will take a turn trying to test the program, with emphasis on how different parts of the program interact with others. If bugs are found, the source will be repaired, and unit tested before attempting another system test.
