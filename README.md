# CS 3450 - Tools Co-op

<<<<<<< HEAD
An explanation of the organization and name scheme for the workspace:
We are going to divide our files into front-end and back-end folders. The front-end files will be divided into separate folders for HTML and JavaScript files.
The back-end files will be hold end points for sending data back to the front-end. We will also have classes that will outline how data will be stored. The 
name scheme that will be followed is variables will be lowercase camel case, classes will be uppercase camel case, private items will be denoted by an underscore.

System testing instructions:
=======
The build instructions for this project are difficult to pin down because we're still in the earlier stages of development. We don't have large amounts of code that needs to be run. We'll update the README as more and more things are implemented.

## Unit testing instructions:

As far as unit testing goes our plan is to have the author of the original code debug it as much as he/she can. Once satisfied, the author will request a review from a different member of the group. This peer reviewer will try his best to find more bugs for the author to sort out. The process can be repeated as many times as necessary.

## System testing instructions:

System testing will be a more rigorous iteration of what was described for the unit testing instructions, but this process will be applied to the system. Each team member will take a turn trying to test the program, with emphasis on how different parts of the program interact with others. If bugs are found, the source will be repaired, and unit tested before attempting another system test.
